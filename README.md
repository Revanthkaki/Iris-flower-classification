# Iris-flower-classification
The Iris Flower Classification project builds a machine learning model to predict the species of an Iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on its sepal and petal measurements. The goal is to achieve high accuracy and identify the most important features influencing the classification.
