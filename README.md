🌸 Iris Flower Classification
📖 Project Description
The Iris Flower Classification project aims to build a machine learning model to accurately classify Iris flowers into three species — Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica — based on measurements of their sepal and petal lengths and widths.
The goal is to achieve high classification accuracy and understand the most significant features affecting the predictions.

📂 Dataset Information
Each sample contains:

Sepal Length (cm)

Sepal Width (cm)

Petal Length (cm)

Petal Width (cm)

Species (target class)

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy)
